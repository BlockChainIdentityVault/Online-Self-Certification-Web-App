This is the source code for the OpenChain Online Self-Certification WebApp.

The application is currently in beta.

The application is located at https://certification.openchainproject.org

The application is primarily driven from a database where all questions and all
answers are stored.

The UI uses jQuery and a jQuery UI front-end.  The primary style sheet is located 
in the WebContent/resources/style directory.

Please feel free to test this code, submit issues, and help make Self-Certification
around the OpenChain Specification easier for everyone.
